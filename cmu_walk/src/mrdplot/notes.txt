mrdplot is data plotting software that runs in Matlab.
Put the .m files in a directory in your Matlab path (see set path
command).
in linux:
$ ls *.m
mrdplot_convert.m  mrdplot_functions.m  mrdplot_gen.m  mrdplot.m
$ cp *.m ~/matlab

mrdplot.c and mrdplot.h are routines to make it easier to read
and write mrdplot format data files.

data is stored grouped by time:
at time = 0: c0 c1 c2 ....
at time = 1: c0 c1 c2 ....
...

To access sequentially:
for ( i = 0; i < d->n_points; i++ )
  for ( j = 0; j < d->n_channels; j++ )
    {
      d->data[i*d->n_channels + j];
    }
